// First time steps:
// 1. rename this file to config.js
// 2. download ngrok with npm install -g ngrok
// 3. run the command 'ngrok 1337' in a terminal window, 
// 4. paste the url it gives you here
// 5. npm start

// You can then access your app from both localhost:1337 and your ngrok URL

// note: if you have ngrok installed you can skip steps 1 and 2, but since your ngrok
// url can change, you must paste the new one in this file every time.
module.exports = {
  ngrok_url: ''
};
